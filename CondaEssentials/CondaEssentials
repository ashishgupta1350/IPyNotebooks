CONDA COMMANDS :

1. conda --version
2. conda activate env_name
3. conda deactivate
4. conda list (Write this to see the packages installed in a particular conda env),(look for an astrix in front of current active conda env)
5. conda create -n env_name python=3.x (eg) # Use this for creating new conda environments
6. conda env list (get list of all conda environments)
7. conda install package_name (Do this in a particular environment)

Benefits of environment(s) :
 We can create different environments for multiple projects , each project can has own set of packages which can be of different versions.  

Something to do in jupyter to assure yourself of python version in ipy notebook and in conda : 

# For ipy kernel , use this :
 import sys
 print(sys.version)
 
# For conda env , use this :
 !python -V
